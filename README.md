# Digit-Recognizer
Project from CS146 Intro to ML

o	Designed a digit recognizer using neural networks where the network was able to learn to take in images of numbers and correctly predict the number shown in the image.

o	Created both one and two layer networks and analyzed the loss and accuracy between the two. 

o	Implemented using PyTorch and different optimizers such as SGD and Adam.
